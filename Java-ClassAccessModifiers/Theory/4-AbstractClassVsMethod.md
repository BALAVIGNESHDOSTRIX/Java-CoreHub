# Note
    - If the method is abstract the class should be declared as abstract
    - If the class is abstract it can also have or may not have the abstract method also possible.

# Usage Of Abstract class method
    - If Anymethod implementation is needed in the all sub class implementation the super class method declared as abstract. so the subclass could not miss the required method implementation
