# Importing Rule

    - Explicit Import
        Imporing the Exact needed class file from root package that is called Expicit Import
            Example:
                import java.util.ArrayList;
    
    - Implicit Import
        Importing the class without Full extension only with root package
        that is called Implicit Import
            Example:
                import java.util.*;

    - Defualt packages
        we dont need to import the default packages in java 

    - If the needed class is in the same directory means we dont need to import that

    - Import Order is
        1. packages
        2. interface declarations
        3. import statements

# Note
    - World wide the Explicit Import is used during the development. because we should know the class where it is reside that is also good practice.
